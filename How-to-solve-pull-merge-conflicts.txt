If git pull gives error due to merge conflicts as 
there are unsaved changes in local repo, then do 
the following:

git stash (all unsaved local changes are pushed in
           a stack/stash)

git pull (pull everything from remote repo)

git stash pop (pop the unsaved local changes)

Now, the automerge tool will resolve conflicts 
automatically.
If there is still conflicts, then open editor and 
resolve conflict manually

<<<<<<<HEAD

===========

& '====' signs!
