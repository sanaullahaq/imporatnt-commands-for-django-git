1. You have created a new repository, added a few commits to it, 
   and now you are trying to pull from a remote repository that 
   already has some commits of its own. Git will throw the 
   error in this case, since it has no idea how the two projects 
   are related.Solve it by pulling with the follwing command 
   instead of git pull only:
   git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories
