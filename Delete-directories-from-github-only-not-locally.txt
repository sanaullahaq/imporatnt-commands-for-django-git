I committed and pushed some directory to github. After that, I altered the .gitignore file 
adding a directory that should be ignored. Everything works fine, but the (now ignored) 
directory stays on github.

How do I delete that directory from github and the repository history?

Use the following code:

git rm -r --cached some-directory
git commit -m 'Remove the now ignored directory "some-directory"'
git push

Explanation:

git rm meanse you want to remove something.
-r means recursive, necessary if you're doing with subdirectories inside. 
--cached overrides git's normal behaviour of deleting them from the working directory 
and staging the deletion for committing, and makes git only operate on the staging area 
ready for committing. It's how you tell git you want to keep your local copies of the files.
