   cmd of Pycharm
3. pip install django
4. django-admin startproject [project-name]
5. cd to [project-name]
6. Always change the root/top-level project folder name to 
   [project-name]_project to avoid confusion of two same-name folders while importing!!!
7. Ensure that you are in [project-name] folder & then
   git init (creating .git for initialization)
8. Create a .gitignore file in root directory using explorer or the following command:
   cd. >.gitignore
9. Add all the files that you want to be untracked.
10.Then create a requirements file using:
   pip freeze > requirements.txt
11.git add. and git commit -m "Git Initialised with gitignore and requirements.txt"
12.git remote add origin "repository url"
13.git push -u origin master
14. python manage.py startapp [app-name]
15. In settings.py, add the [app-name] in the Installed Apps section.

16. Create a folder templates inside the [project-name] directory and
   add the following code in the Templates section of settings.py. 
   'DIRS': [os.path.join(BASE_DIR,'templates')],

17. python manage.py runserver (checks if the server is working)
